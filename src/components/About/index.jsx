      Hi Iâ€™m Johann, and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Human Organizational Development at Vanderbilt University. 
      <br/>
      <p className="empty-line"></p>
      A little about myself, I originate from a small, farm town in the Upper Cumberlands of Tennessee, but for the past few years I have been 
      calling Nashville my home to pursue my college education as I prepare to start a career in technology. 
      <p className="empty-line"></p>

      I have impactful, professional experience being an part of multiple development teams developing software applications. 
      <br/>
      <p className="empty-line"></p>

      And I believe I am just getting started, one of the many things I love about being a programmer is that you really never stop learning. 
      <br/>
      <p className="empty-line"></p>
      My next goal in my career is to contribute to and 
      become a part of a team or organization that shares my appreciation for the impact technology can have on all sectors of life. 
      I believe software is our greatest expression of human creativity and achievement.
